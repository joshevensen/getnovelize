# The Rebirth of Novelize

Something special is happening at Novelize. After years of steady growth and serving thousands of writers, we're entering a new chapter—one filled with fresh energy, renewed commitment, and a crystal-clear vision.

## A New Team with the Same Mission

For over 9 years, Novelize has been helping writers finish their novels. We've watched 6,000+ writers start 12,300+ projects, and we've learned a lot about what writers really need: **a tool that gets out of the way and lets you write**.

Now, with our expanded team—Josh, Melanie, and Benji—we're doubling down on that mission. We're not here to add complexity or flashy features you'll never use. We're here to make sure Novelize remains the simplest, most reliable writing tool you'll ever use.

## What We're Fighting Against

We know what it's like out there. Writing tools have become bloated, intimidating, and overwhelming. They promise everything but deliver confusion. They're built for "productivity experts" and "power users," not for the novelist who just wants to finish their story.

That's not us.

## Our Commitment to You

Here's what we promise:

### **Simplicity First**

No feature bloat. No confusing menus. Just a clean, focused editor that helps you write.

### **Reliability You Can Trust**

Your words are automatically saved, backed up, and always accessible. We take that responsibility seriously.

### **A Tool That Fits You**

Whether you're writing your first fanfic or your tenth novel, Novelize is built for how you actually write—not how some productivity guru says you should.

### **Real Support from Real People**

When you reach out, you're talking to us—the people who build and run Novelize. No outsourced support. No corporate scripts. Just us, genuinely trying to help.

## What's Coming

We're not just maintaining Novelize—we're actively improving it. Over the coming months, you'll see:

- Performance improvements that make everything faster
- Small, thoughtful features based on your feedback
- Better mobile experience for writing on the go
- More content like this blog: writing tips, author spotlights, and community stories

But here's what won't change: **our focus on simplicity and reliability**. Every feature we add must pass a simple test: Does this help you write? If not, it doesn't belong in Novelize.

## Thank You for Being Here

To everyone who's written a single word in Novelize—thank you. You're the reason we're here. Your stories matter, whether they're shared with millions or kept private in your notebook.

We're committed to being the writing tool you can trust, today and for years to come.

Now, let's get back to what matters most: **your story**.
