## Core Features

### Write Without Fear

Every writer worries about losing their words. Fanfic writers also worry about something else: censorship. Novelize protects you from both. Your stories are private by default — no algorithms reading them, no platform deciding what’s “acceptable.” You control what stays private and what gets shared.

With Novelize, you get peace of mind because:

- Every word is saved automatically.
- We keep secure backups so nothing gets lost.
- Your work is yours alone until you choose otherwise.

---

### Characters & Worldbuilding

Stories aren’t just words on a page — they’re people, places, and details that need to stay consistent. With the Notebook always at your side, you can track character traits, relationship arcs, and worldbuilding notes without breaking your writing flow.

Instead of juggling sticky notes or scattered docs, you can:

- Keep character bios, AU variations, and relationship notes in one place.
- Store research, rules, and lore where they’re easy to reference.
- Jump between notes and your draft without losing momentum.

---

### Write Anywhere, Distraction-Free

Inspiration doesn’t wait for the “right time.” That’s why Novelize works wherever you are — on desktop, laptop, tablet, or phone. If you can open a browser, you can start writing.

The editor itself is designed to get out of your way. Clean, uncluttered, and customizable with dark or light mode, it keeps your focus where it belongs: on your words. Write a scene during your commute, finish it at your desk, and pick up again later — everything stays synced.

## Supporting Features

**Heading:**

# About

# About Novelize

## Hero

**Headline:**
Built by a developer, shaped by writers

**Subhead:**
Novelize started as a simple side project to make writing easier. Today, it's grown into a family-run app used by thousands of storytellers around the world.

---

## Our Story

Scrivener had a 300+ page manual. Even as a software engineer, I found it overwhelming. So I built my own tool — something simple, focused, and easy to use. My wife liked it so much she suggested I share it with others.

I opened it up in 2016, and Novelize has been a steady side business ever since. Nearly a decade later, my two oldest children have joined me to help turn Novelize into something bigger than it's ever been.

---

## What We Believe

We believe writers deserve a simple tool that:

- Gives them just enough features.
- Stays out of the way.
- Keeps their writing safe and secure.

We're not trying to be everything for everyone. Novelize won't replace publishing tools — you only use those occasionally. What we do is focus on the one thing you do every day: write.

---

## The Numbers

Since launching in 2016, writers have used Novelize to:

- Start over **12,300 novels**
- Create more than **39,000 notebook entries**
- Join a community of over **6,000 users**

---

## The Team

We're a small family team, building Novelize together.

**Josh — Founder, Developer**
I've been a software engineer for over 10 years, and I built Novelize while I was learning PHP. I've been improving it ever since. My passion is user experience — creating software that feels simple and improves people's lives.

**Melanie — Marketing Specialist**
Melanie is a writer and artist who lives on AO3 and Tumblr. They're passionate about helping writers find tips, tricks, and tools to succeed — and they bring that same energy to growing Novelize's community.

**Benji — Customer Support Specialist**
Benji discovered a love for helping people while volunteering at a local museum. Now they take care of our amazing users and test new features before release.
