# Outline, Write, and Organize Modes

## Overview
Novelize supports three ways to approach your novel.

## Outline Mode
- Plan your story structure.  
- Add summaries, chapter descriptions, and scene notes.  
- Content here does not count toward word count or export.

## Write Mode
- Draft scenes in full.  
- Scene notes carry over for easy reference.  
- Access summaries and descriptions via the left panel.

## Organize Mode
- Reorder scenes and chapters.  
- Use up/down arrows for small screens.  
- Drag-and-drop is planned to return.
