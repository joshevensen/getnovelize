We’re excited to introduce **Cynthia Frazier-Buck**, who has recently self-published her first novel. Like many other writers, she has always dreamed of writing a book someday. With the help of Camp NaNoWriMo and Novelize, she made it happen! In this interview, she reveals how she accomplished her goal.

## What made you decide to write a novel?

In my author bio, I joke that my Mom always told me that I should write a book, and so I did. That’s true, but it’s always been a dream of mine to write.

I love reading and every time I picked up a book, I’d think to myself, “You should write one of these someday.” A few years ago, I realized that if I didn’t get serious about writing, my dream would go unfulfilled. I started out writing short stories and flash fiction, most of which have never seen the light of day. But I got in the habit of writing and built up the confidence to write a book.

## What is your novel about?

It’s a reimagining of the film _Pretty In Pink._ As a teen in the eighties, John Hughes’ films were a huge part of my life. They still are! I watch those movies an embarrassing amount and have started watching them with my teenager.

One night, I was watching _Pretty In Pink_ for probably the 714th time, and I had an “aha” moment. Why not put my own spin on Hughes’ classic? It was an idea I got really excited about so I went with it!

## Tell us about your writing process. How often did you write, and how did you make time for working on your novel?

I started writing _A Sky Full Of Stars_ in April 2018 for Camp NaNoWriMo. I finished the draft, but it was really rough! Over the next year, I rewrote, revised, and made edits until I was satisfied with what I had on the page.

I didn’t write or work on the manuscript every single day. I have two kids, a husband, a dog, and a never-ending to-do list, and some days I just can’t make writing the priority. I still haven’t found the elusive work/life balance!

Mainly, I wrote while the kids were at school and during the weekends. On days where very little was going on, I would try to write for longer stretches of time. Somehow, things have a way of working out!

## Do you have plans for other novels?

Yes! I’m working now on a YA holiday romance. I hope that one will be ready for publication by the holidays this year.

I also have started a New Adult manuscript, which I’ve put aside while I work on the holiday story.

## Will there be a sequel to your novel?

I have thought about it, but I’ve not decided just yet. I think it might be fun to continue my character’s story, but on the other hand, I like the idea of the readers deciding for themselves what happens after _The End!_

## How did you hear about Novelize?

I bought a Chromebook in a hurry when the laptop I had started malfunctioning. I did a Google search for writing software that was compatible and I found Novelize!

I’m so glad I did! I love that Novelize is web-based, plus it’s so easy to use. I was using another writing software before that was not as user-friendly and it took up so much of my computer’s storage. Now that I’ve found Novelize I will never look back!

## How did Novelize help you write your novel?

Novelize is very straightforward. I love that within the chapters you can easily write and keep track of different scenes without breaking your stride. You even have the ability to make a note at the top of the chapter and at the top of the different scenes to use as a quick reference.

It’s so nice to look at those to find what you’re looking for instead of sifting through the chapter text! It’s also easy to rearrange chapters if you need to. I’ve never been a big outliner, but Novelize helps me make at least a basic outline of my story so that I can stay on track.

And I really love the Notebook feature! It’s very handy to have all your notes in one place, whether they be about your characters, the setting, or any other tidbits you need to keep track of.

## Do you have any tips for other writers who are just getting started with their first novel?

Every writer has their own process, so find what works best for you. It may take some trial and error, but once you find what works best, just keep at it! And every writer’s journey is different, so don’t compare yours to someone else’s.
