**Eric Schumacher** is living proof that it’s possible to prioritize an author career despite having a full-time job and a family. He has already penned several novels. Before you despair and proclaim you can’t do the same, know that it took him 10 years to release the first one. Writing is a lifelong journey. In this interview, Eric shares what made him turn to writing in the first place, how he approaches the work, and what his most recent novel is all about.

## What made you decide to write a novel?

Ever since I was in elementary school, I had ideas for books and would actively work on them after school. I never thought of selling them. I suppose I was too young to know I could.

It wasn’t until I was in my late 20s that I consciously decided to write a novel to sell. I remember the moment distinctly. I was in a park, studying for an exam, when the thought occurred to me that I should write a book. As soon as the thought struck me, I knew it was right and that I would. It took me 10 years, but I eventually released _God’s Hammer_ in 2004.

## What is your novel about?

I have written several novels now.

The first three (collectively known as _Hakon’s Saga_) tell the story of King Hakon Haraldsson, a bastard Christian prince who once fought for the throne of Viking Age Norway.

The most recent novel, which launched on April 15, 2020, is called _Forged by Iron._ It is the first in a series of action-packed books about the legendary and enigmatic Viking king named Olaf Tryggvason.

## Tell us about your writing process. How often did you write, and how did you make time for working on your novel?

I have a day job and two children, so finding time to write is not always easy. My only set time to write is Sunday afternoons. Beyond that, I try to write several nights each week.

Given my crazy schedule, I try not to be too strict about fixed times or word counts to hit each week, otherwise I end up just getting frustrated when I don’t hit those goals. The one loose goal I have is to write a book a year. Since 2017, I’ve been able to keep that pace going more or less.

## Do you have plans for other novels?

I do! Olaf’s story will span four or five novels. I am already working on the second novel in that series.

I love historical fiction, and in particular, the early medieval period. There are so many fascinating characters and events, many which could lend themselves well to novels. So yes –– I have a lot of ideas for books. It’s really just a matter of figuring out which will make the best stories.

## How did you hear about Novelize?

I used to write in Microsoft Word, but keeping track of all the chapters and research in separate documents just got too burdensome. So I started looking around for a solution. After some online research, and some trial and error, I landed on Novelize.

## How did Novelize help you write your novel?

There are several things I absolutely love about Novelize. Since I write historical fiction, I research a lot for my books. Novelize keeps everything in one spot, so it is super easy to jump back and forth between my writing and my research.

It is also cloud-based, so it saves my work regularly. There is nothing worse than writing something you really like only to have Word crash and lose it all. Novelize solves that.

Third, I couple Novelize with another solution called Grammarly, which enables me to edit while I write. That simplifies the editing process later on.

I also love the interface of Novelize. It’s clean and inviting and limits distractions.

Finally, downloading my novel into a readable format is really simple with Novelize, so when it’s time to start sharing my novel with beta readers or my editor, it saves a lot of time.

## Do you have any tips for other writers who are just getting started with their first novel?

Yes! First and foremost, dream big and don’t get discouraged. Reaching the end of your book, or finding an agent, or finding a publisher, may all feel like insurmountable mountains, but they’re not. Just keep moving forward, one step, one word, at a time.

Second, write the best book you possibly can. Really spend time to get it exactly the way you want it. Once you’re finished, turn it over to beta readers who you trust to tell you the truth. And, if you can afford it, give it to a professional editor. It is amazing what they will notice and the mistakes they will catch.

Finally, keep writing and keep reading, especially books within your genre. These endeavors will fill you with fresh ideas and help you hone your craft, both of which are invaluable.
