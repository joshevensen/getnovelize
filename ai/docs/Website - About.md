## Our Mission
To help every writer — from hobbyists to fanfic authors to novelists — finish their stories with focus, organization, and peace of mind.

## Origin Story
Every story has a beginning. Ours started with one simple goal: make writing easier.  
We were tired of juggling sticky notes, scattered docs, and tools that weren’t built for novelists.  

So we built the writing space we wanted for ourselves — a clean, reliable place to focus on the story. That space grew into Novelize, now trusted by thousands of writers around the world. After more than 8 years, the mission is still the same: keep you writing.
