# State of Novelize

_September 2025_

## Where We Are Now

Novelize is alive again. After years of running on autopilot with decaying infrastructure, the foundation is finally being rebuilt.

**Infrastructure**

- New servers are online. The old scene history DB was on life support; now the system can actually breathe.
- Laravel app is back under active deployment via Forge + Envoyer.
- Dependencies are outdated but being upgraded incrementally.
- Save script will be modernized to guarantee reliability — no excuses on lost words.

**Team**

- **Josh**: code, infra, business direction.
- **Melanie**: marketing/content, restarting channels (Tumblr, Reddit, YouTube) and learning as she goes.
- **Benji**: support/QA, directly handling customers and surfacing bugs. They’ve proven better at this than expected — users are being answered quickly and with care.

**Community & Marketing**

- Blog hasn’t been touched in years. That changes. Author spotlights and steady updates will be the minimum bar.
- Social presence is restarting: Tumblr, Reddit, YouTube. Newsletter and podcasts are under consideration.
- Marketing site is being rebuilt so Melanie and Benji can publish without developer bottlenecks.

**Current Metrics (Stripe)**

- **MRR**: $1,634.84 (down ~$237 YoY)
- **Net Volume (12 mo)**: $19,537.98
- **Active Subscribers**: 293 (down 58 YoY)
- **New Subs (12 mo)**: 102
- **Churned Subs (12 mo)**: 216
- **ARPU**: $5.57
- **LTV**: $153.87
- **Trials (12 mo)**: 189 new / 80 converted (33.3% conversion)
- **Active Trials**: 4
- **Churn Rate**: 3.6%
- **Gross MRR Churn**: 3.9%
- **Net MRR Churn**: 2.5%

**Plans**

- Legacy: $5/mo (15 active), $45/yr (97 active)
- Current (since Jan 2021): $9/mo (71 active), $45/yr (17 active), $65/yr (112 active)
- Total: ~293 subs

## Recent Shifts

- Decision made: stop coasting, rebuild trust.
- Melanie and Benji are taking ownership of marketing and support.
- Audience pivot: instead of chasing “serious novelists,” we’re explicitly targeting **hobby writers and fanfiction communities**. They want reliability, no censorship, and the safety of knowing their words won’t vanish.

## Where We’re Going

**Product**

- Keep stabilizing infrastructure.
- Update dependencies.
- Switch editor and improve UX.
- Collaboration is the long-term differentiator, but foundation comes first.
- Core promise: **words are never lost, never censored.**

**Community**

- Reintroduce Novelize through Tumblr, Reddit, YouTube.
- Use blog for author spotlights and progress updates.

**Marketing**

- Relaunch site with easy editing.
- Switch to **30-day free trial, no credit card**.
- Use blog posts as credibility signals, tied into community and newsletter.

**Identity**

- Brand voice: approachable, honest, creator-first.
- Values: reliability, transparency, freedom to write.

**Short-Term Roadmap**

1. Relaunch marketing site (lightweight, modern, editable by team).
2. Implement 30-day trial change.
3. Publish consistent author spotlights + updates.
4. Show visible progress on infrastructure and UX.
