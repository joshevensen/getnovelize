# Novelize Team

## Team Members & Core Roles

- **Josh** – Dev / Product / Business  
  Responsible for the codebase, infrastructure, and product direction. Owns business decisions and revenue strategy.

- **Melanie** – Marketing / Content  
  Focused on Tumblr, Reddit, and the blog. Handles content creation, community engagement, and exploring new channels like a newsletter or podcast appearances.

- **Benji** – Support / QA  
  Point of contact for user support. Tests new features, identifies bugs, and helps ensure a stable product experience.

## How We Work

- **Priority Areas**: Each person leads in their main lane (above), but no one is limited to only those areas.
- **Collaboration**: Anyone can contribute ideas or help across marketing, support, product, or strategy when they feel they can add value.
- **Communication**: We’ll keep updates simple and regular. Progress, blockers, and ideas should be shared openly so the whole team stays aligned.
- **Momentum**: Small, visible wins matter more than big plans that sit unfinished. We’ll aim to ship updates and publish content consistently to rebuild user trust.

## Current Focus

1. Update and stabilize infrastructure (servers, dependencies, save script).
2. Relaunch marketing site with a lightweight, modern design.
3. Restart community presence on Tumblr, Reddit, and the blog.
4. Switch to a 30-day free trial with no credit card upfront.
5. Show users clear signs of life with consistent communication.
