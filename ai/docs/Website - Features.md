## The Big Three

### Your Words Are Safe

Autosave, backups, and scene history mean you’ll never lose progress. Your story stays private, secure, and under your control.

- Every keystroke saved automatically (IconDeviceFloppy)
- Cloud backups for peace of mind (IconCloudUpload)
- Roll back with full scene history (IconHistory)

**Screenshot recommendation:** Show the editor with the _Scene History_ panel open (timeline of previous versions visible). This makes the safety net feel real.

### Stay Organized, Without the Overwhelm

Break your book into scenes, keep characters and notes in one place, and restructure as you go. It’s structure that helps, not clutter that overwhelms.

- Scene and chapter organization (IconLayoutCards)
- Notebook for characters, places, and notes (IconNotebook)
- Drag-and-drop to rearrange your story (IconArrowsMove)

**Screenshot recommendation:** Show the _Organize Mode_ or Notebook side panel, with scenes or chapters draggable. This visually conveys flexible structure.

### Write Anywhere, With Calm

A distraction-free space that works on laptop, tablet, or phone. Wherever inspiration strikes, Novelize is there with a clean, cozy editor.

- Mobile and desktop friendly (IconDevices)
- Distraction-free writing mode (IconFocus2)
- Dark mode for day or night writing (IconMoonStars)

**Screenshot recommendation:** Show the clean _Distraction-Free Editor_ with a large text area, no side panels, ideally in Dark Mode. Bonus if shown on both desktop and phone mockups.
