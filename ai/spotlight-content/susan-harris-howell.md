Meet **Susan Harris Howell**, author of the nonfiction work _Buried Talents_. Her first book covers a topic dear to her heart: how men and women are socialized differently and what we can do about it. We’re so excited for her success!

## What made you decide to write a book?

I teach a college course on how men and women relate to each other and realized that there wasn’t a book out there that covered some of the material I wanted to include. I then realized that if that book didn’t exist, maybe it should. So I wrote it!

## What is your book about?

My book is entitled: _Buried Talents: Overcoming Gendered Socialization to Answer God’s Call._

Although this isn’t a novel, it’s a book about how men and women are socialized differently, with the difference too often pushing men toward leadership and women away from it. It was released on **April 26, 2022.**

## Tell us about your writing process. How often did you write, and how did you make time for working?

I am a full-time faculty member at Campbellsville University in Kentucky. I intentionally don’t teach during summer months so I can devote my time to writing. But even so, I never would have had the time to write this particular book without the university’s help. They gave me a one-semester sabbatical so I could write. The book took longer than that to write, but it made it doable.

## Do you have plans for other books?

I liked writing this non-fiction piece, but I don’t have plans for another.

I am, however, writing a novel as well. It’s a cozy mystery with elements of magical realism. And, yes, I definitely hope to write more within the same genre.

## Will there be a sequel to your novel?

Yes! I love the characters and want to see what happens to them down the line!

## How did you hear about Novelize?

I googled programs like Novelize because I was dissatisfied with the steep learning curve some others required. I hardly had time to write, much less learn a new program that was rather complicated. Then I found Novelize and was so relieved that within minutes I was using it like a pro.

## How did Novelize help you write your book?

It helped me organize my work. And I liked having my work secured in one place.

For my fiction piece, the tabs for characters, locations, and summaries prompted me to think of things I had not considered before which helped me have a more complete picture of each of my characters, their motivations, strengths, weaknesses, etc.

I also loved that I could move chapters and scenes around so easily.

## Do you have any tips for other writers who are just getting started with their first novel?

Go to conferences, read good books about writing well. But mostly just start writing.
