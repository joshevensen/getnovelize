## Our Story

Scrivener had a 300+ page manual. Even as a software engineer, I found it overwhelming. So I built my own tool — something simple, focused, and easy to use. My wife liked it so much she suggested I share it with others.

I opened it up in 2016, and Novelize has been a steady side business ever since. Nearly a decade later, my two oldest children have joined me to help turn Novelize into something bigger than it's ever been.

## What We Believe

We believe writers deserve a simple tool that:

- Gives them just enough features.
- Stays out of the way.
- Keeps their writing safe and secure.

We're not trying to be everything for everyone. Novelize won't replace publishing tools — you only use those occasionally. What we do is focus on the one thing you do every day: write.
