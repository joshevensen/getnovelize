## Core Features

### Write Without Fear

Every writer worries about losing their words. Fanfic writers also worry about something else: censorship. Novelize protects you from both. Your stories are private by default — no algorithms reading them, no platform deciding what’s “acceptable.” You control what stays private and what gets shared.

With Novelize, you get peace of mind because:

- Every word is saved automatically.
- We keep secure backups so nothing gets lost.
- Your work is yours alone until you choose otherwise.

### Characters & Worldbuilding

Stories aren’t just words on a page — they’re people, places, and details that need to stay consistent. With the Notebook always at your side, you can track character traits, relationship arcs, and worldbuilding notes without breaking your writing flow.

Instead of juggling sticky notes or scattered docs, you can:

- Keep character bios, AU variations, and relationship notes in one place.
- Store research, rules, and lore where they’re easy to reference.
- Jump between notes and your draft without losing momentum.

### Write Anywhere, Distraction-Free

Inspiration doesn’t wait for the “right time.” That’s why Novelize works wherever you are — on desktop, laptop, tablet, or phone. If you can open a browser, you can start writing.

The editor itself is designed to get out of your way. Clean, uncluttered, and customizable with dark or light mode, it keeps your focus where it belongs: on your words. Write a scene during your commute, finish it at your desk, and pick up again later — everything stays synced.
