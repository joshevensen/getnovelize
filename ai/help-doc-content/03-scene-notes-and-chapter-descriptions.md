# Scene Notes and Chapter Descriptions

## Overview
Scene notes and chapter descriptions help you outline and track your story without affecting your word count.

## Scene Notes
- Found at the end of each scene.
- In **Write Mode**, click the **Notes** link below the scene.
- In **Outline Mode**, only notes are shown, not the full scene text.

## Chapter Descriptions

- These appear in the **Summaries** tab in the left panel.
- They are not counted in your word count or manuscript export.
