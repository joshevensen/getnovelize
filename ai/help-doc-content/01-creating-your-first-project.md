# Creating Your First Project

## Overview
When you log into Novelize for the first time, youâ€™ll be guided to create your first project. A project is where all your chapters, scenes, and notes live.

## Steps
1. Log into your account.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Enter your project title and (optionally) a subtitle or description.
4. Your first chapter and scene will be created automatically.

## Notes
- You can manage project details (title, subtitle, author name, genre, goals) later via the **Manage** tab.
