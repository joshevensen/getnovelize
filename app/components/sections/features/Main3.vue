        If you can open a browser, you can start writing. The editor itself is
        designed to get out of your way. Clean, uncluttered, and customizable
        with dark or light mode, it keeps your focus where it belongs: on your
        words. Write a scene during your commute, finish it at your desk, and
        pick up again later â€” everything stays synced.
