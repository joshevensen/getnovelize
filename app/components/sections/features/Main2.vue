        With the Notebook always at your side, you can track character traits,
        relationship arcs, and worldbuilding notes without breaking your writing
        flow. Instead of juggling sticky notes or scattered docs, you can keep
        character bios, AU variations, and relationship notes in one place,
        store research, rules, and lore where they're easy to reference, and
        jump between notes and your draft without losing momentum.
