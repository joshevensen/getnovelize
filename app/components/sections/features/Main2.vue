            With the Notebook always at your side, you can track character
            traits, relationship arcs, and worldbuilding notes without breaking
            your writing flow. Instead of juggling sticky notes or scattered
            docs, you can keep character bios, AU variations, and relationship
            notes in one place, store research, rules, and lore where they're
            easy to reference, and jump between notes and your draft without
            losing momentum.
