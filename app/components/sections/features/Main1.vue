        Your stories are private by default — no algorithms reading them, no
        platform deciding what's "acceptable." You control what stays private
        and what gets shared. With Novelize, you get peace of mind because every
        word is saved automatically, we keep secure backups so nothing gets
        lost, and your work is yours alone until you choose otherwise.
